Install android USB driver under windows XP:
--------------------------------------------

The HTC device was not recognized by the laptop, and it did not show up when typing 'adb devices' at the prompt. 
Upon closer examination, it turned out that the device was recognized as a disk drive, but not as an android device. 
Uninstalling the devices from the windows and reinstalling it did not help, as the hardware wizard automatically 
added it back as a disk drive. Found a post online that mentioned USBDeview utility. Downloaded and ran tool. 
Right-clicked on HTC entry and selected uninstall. Kept tool running and with the device still connected to the 
laptop manually started hardware wizard from control panel. This time, the wizard brought up a dialog that allowed 
selection of a location for the driver. Chose $ANDROID_HOME/usb_driver. Rebooted after completed install. Device 
now shows up correctly for 'adb devices'.
