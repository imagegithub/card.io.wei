Android Image asset requirements:
---------------------------------

Summary:

Android image assets now come in four sizes:
low, medium, high and extra-high, which are abbreviated ldpi, mdpi, hdpi, and xhdpi.
xhdpi was introduced with Android 3.0 and is optional (mostly targeted at tablets)

mdpi is the baseline and will be used if no others are available. Failure to supply an mdpi image when other resolutions are present is a compile error.

Icons are square and have the following sizes:
36, 48, 72, and 96, which correspond to scaling factors of 0.75, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0

Image assets must conform to the following naming rules:
- lowercase and underscores only.
- stored in res/drawable-X/ where X is ldpi, mdpi, hdpi and xhdpi.
- files for the same resource must be named identically in the various resolution directories.

Buttons should at minimum supply state images for the "pressed" and "focused" states in addition to the default look.
- This means there will be at least 9 .pngs for each button background
- An xml file in res/drawable defines which images are used for which context.
- LL suggested naming convention: button_foo_default.png, button_foo_pressed.png, and button_foo_focused.png (or *.9.png, if appropriate)
- If button_foo.xml defines the button drawable, button_foo.png must NOT be present.

Rescaleable buttons should be specified as 9-patch images:
- the draw9patch tool is available as part of the sdk-tools, but a 9 patch image is just a PNG with a 1 pixel border.
- 9patch images have the .9.png extension. It is a compile error to have a foo.png and foo.9.png in the same project.
- Black pixels in the top or left margin indicate a stretchable region.
- Black pixels in the bottom or right margin indicate the content area. If a button's text exceeds this region, the button will be stretched.
